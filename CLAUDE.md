# CLAUDE.md — theprojection-corpus (instance #1)

Ben's personal intelligence layer: **buffer + extract, never own the source
data**. Four lenses (ai · global-capital · mental-health · world-news); the
product is the attention map (`attention/` — watchlist entities, weighted
threads, expectations ledger) and the thread-centric weekly read built from
it (rendered page + daily digest archive; AGENTS.md disciplines 7–8).

## The engine/instance split (2026-07-31)

This repo is **instance #1** of the kestrel engine — the DATA (attention/,
artifacts/, sources/, provenance/, templates/) plus the operating skills
and docs. The CODE (collectors/, tools/) lives in `/workspace/kestrel`,
which tends this repo and `therapybulletin-data` both. `kestrel.yaml` at this
root is the instance manifest.

**Invocation rule:** any `tools/*.py` mentioned in the skills/docs means
the ENGINE's tools, run as:

    KESTREL_INSTANCE=/workspace/theprojection-data \
      python3 /workspace/kestrel/tools/<tool>.py

Set `KESTREL_INSTANCE=/workspace/theprojection-data` for every engine tool
invocation from this repo — without it the tools fall back to looking for
instance data inside kestrel, where it no longer lives. Engine changes
belong in kestrel (its `ROADMAP/DESIGN.md` is the split's design of
record); this repo's history before 2026-07-31 lives in kestrel's git
history (tag `pre-engine-split` and earlier).

**Read first:** `AGENTS.md` (disciplines, operating rhythm, steering loop) →
`README.md` (layout + contracts) → `STATUS.md` (where things stand) →
`ROADMAP.md` (decisions + sequence, incl. the delivery surfaces) →
`BOOTSTRAP.md` (build state, done-whens, gates) → `DESIGN.md` (the board as
a node + claim graph — schema shapes + pipeline).

**The commands:** `/start` · `/daily` · `/week` · `/steer` · `/crawl` ·
`/map` · `/publish` · `/classify` (`.claude/skills/`). Templates in
`templates/`.
Zero coupling to sibling corpora — never read them; everything needed is
distilled in `REBUILD-NOTES.md`.

Never: canonicalize source data · edit `attention/` outside the steering
loop (provenance tag every change) · let an LLM-edited YAML file go
unvalidated (`yaml.safe_load` or revert).

## Cite every metric — the source is the receipt (Ben, 2026-07-26)

**Every claim on the board carries a cited source — above all the four
measured axes (commanded_capital / thrust / gravity / optionality) and
posture.** The value on the board is a *summary*;
the source is the *receipt*, and Ben must be able to **see and click the
justification for every claim**, especially the cap/opt/grav metrics.

- **Where sources live:** a per-node bundle
  `artifacts/bundles/<node-slug>-node/provenance.yaml`, shape:
  `{ posture: {value, basis, sources[]}, capital: {available|operating|
  deployed|in|out: {value, sources[]}}, optionality: {value, sources[]},
  gravity: {value, sources[]} }` — each source is
  `{figure, label, url, as_of, confidence}`. Capital is a **flow** (in ·
  out · available · operating · deployed), not one static pile — fill what's
  gettable, rough is fine.
- **Discipline:** no cap/opt/grav or posture claim ships without at least
  one source, or an explicit `confidence: low` / "estimate, uncited" flag.
  WebFetch primary sources (SEC/EDGAR, IR, gov filings) + reputable trackers;
  never fabricate a URL or figure — flag low-confidence instead.
- **The publisher exports the bundle sources into `data/board.json`**, and
  the `/map` node + pocket pages **render the justification inline and
  clickable** under each metric. A metric with no visible source is a bug.
- The board.yaml axis strings stay the one-line summary; the bundle is the
  evidence layer behind them (same relationship as a thread → its `/crawl`
  bundle).
