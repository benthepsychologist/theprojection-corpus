# AWS/Amazon AI infrastructure capex — timeline

*Watch:* Amazon reports earnings ~07-31 — the first real test of this
thread. Part of `hyperscaler-capex-big-picture`.

## 2026-07-30 — The test fires: AWS grows 37%, fastest in 18 quarters

- **Amazon's Q2 print is this thread's clean answer.** Net sales $200.6B
  (+20% YoY, beat ~$196-197B consensus); **AWS revenue $42.2B (+37% YoY —
  "fastest growth in 18 quarters"),** a significant beat against the
  ~31-33% consensus growth rate. AWS operating margin 39.4%, operating
  income $16.6B (+64% YoY). Property/equipment purchases up **$66.1B**
  YoY, funding the AI infrastructure buildout this thread tracks.

- **Net income ($62.6B, $5.75 EPS) is not the organic story** — $53.4B of
  it is a non-operating gain from Amazon's Anthropic investment, not
  operating performance. Cross-reference `ai-circular-financing-risk`
  (Microsoft's own Anthropic stake gained $3.2B the same reporting
  season — a much smaller mark, different scale entirely). ⟨daily 2026-07-30⟩
- **Q3 guidance: net sales $197.0-202.0B (9-12% growth), operating income
  $22.5-26.5B.** ⟨daily 2026-07-30⟩

## 2026-07-28 — Two AWS sites in Bahrain confirmed damaged by satellite imagery

- **Bloomberg reports satellite imagery showing significant damage to two
  Amazon data centres in Bahrain** (Zallaq and Askar), corroborating IRGC
  claims made via Tasnim. The first war in which commercial datacentres
  have been deliberately targeted, with published damage assessment.

- **⚠ The imagery is new; the strikes are not.** Claimed ~**07-21**, after
  Shahed drone attacks on AWS sites in the **UAE (03-01)** and a further
  Bahrain strike (**04-01**). Recorded as corroboration, not a fresh
  attack. ⟨daily 2026-07-28⟩
- **The capex read:** Amazon has committed ~$200B to the 2026 buildout and
  just sold **$25B of bonds** to finance it. Physical loss of regional
  capacity — and the insurance/siting repricing behind it — is a cost line
  this thread has never had to model. Watch whether the 07-30 print or
  call mentions it at all. ⟨daily 2026-07-28⟩

## 2026-07-23 — Thread opened; first signal is a headcount cut, not capex

- **Opened alongside its three siblings** (google-capex, meta-capex,
  microsoft-capex) so the term list catches AWS capex news going forward
  — no dedicated item swept yet, stated plainly rather than backfilled
  with a stretch. ⟨steer 2026-07-23⟩
- **Amazon cut AGI research roles** (model-customization/post-training)
  while the $200B 2026 capex plan holds — a pivot toward enterprise
  deployment over frontier research, not a capex-figure change; first
  real test is the ~07-31 earnings call.

- **The capex buys landlord capacity, not a frontier-research bid** —
  the AGI-team cuts and the $200B plan read as coherent, not
  contradictory: Anthropic committed over $100B to AWS over the next
  decade (2026-04-20) and OpenAI signed a separate $100B/8-year AWS
  compute deal (2026-02-27, alongside a $50B Amazon-into-OpenAI
  investment). AWS's Q1 2026 backlog hit $364B, up from $244B, excluding
  the Anthropic deal.

- **Project Rainier (New Carlisle, Indiana) came online 2025-10-29** —
  ~500,000 Trainium2 chips, built for Anthropic, one of the world's
  largest AI compute clusters, initial $11B investment; a further $15B
  followed for more Indiana capacity (2025-11-24). Mississippi's
  commitment was raised to $25B (2026-04-09); Pennsylvania ($20B,
  2025-06-09) and a new ~$10B North Carolina site (2026-07-20) round out
  the confirmed US build-out.

- **AWS-Anthropic relationship grew, not shrank, despite Anthropic's
  Google TPU deal** — ten days after Anthropic expanded with Google and
  Broadcom for TPU capacity (2026-04-06/07), Anthropic and Amazon
  announced an expanded deal: Anthropic already on 1M+ Trainium2 chips,
  nearly 1GW combined Trainium2/3 capacity by end of 2026 (headroom to
  5GW), Amazon investing up to $25B in Anthropic. Reads as multi-cloud
  diversification, not AWS displacement — no numeric compute split
  across AWS/Google/Microsoft exists in any source found.

- **Power: 1.92GW under firm nuclear PPA now, 5GW+ SMR pipeline by
  2039** — the AWS-Talen 17-year PPA (1,920 MW from Susquehanna, through
  2042, ~$18B) was restructured in 2025-06 specifically to avoid the
  FERC approval that killed the original 2024 co-located deal. X-Energy
  (Amazon-backed, IPO'd 2026-04-23 raising ~$1.02B) joined the DOE's
  Project Prometheus alongside NVIDIA and AWS on 2026-07-22, reaffirming
  the 5GW-by-2039 nuclear option.

- **The OpenAI ~$50B deal is CONFIRMED, not a rumor** — officially
  announced 2026-02-27: $50B total Amazon-into-OpenAI investment plus an
  expanded $100B/8-year AWS compute deal, ~2GW Trainium capacity, AWS as
  exclusive third-party cloud distributor for OpenAI's "Frontier"
  platform. Triggered a Microsoft exclusivity dispute that resolved
  2026-04-27 (Microsoft's exclusivity ended; OpenAI now multi-clouds
  across AWS and Azure; hard 2032 Microsoft-OpenAI partnership end date).

- **Earnings-date correction:** Amazon's Q2 2026 call is confirmed for
  **2026-07-30**, not "~07-31" as this thread's watch line has said since
  opening — worth fixing on next `/daily`/`/steer` touch. Watch for: a
  raised $200B capex guide (Alphabet just raised its own 2026 guide
  07-22/23), backlog growth past $364B, FCF commentary (Amazon reportedly
  borrowing an extra $25B as FCF turns negative under the capex load,
  per TIKR/Motley Fool 07-08/09), and any analyst question on the AGI
  cuts vs. capex tension. ⟨crawl 2026-07-27⟩
- **Open gap:** the brief's "$151B TTM" capex figure was not
  independently confirmed this crawl — every direct-fetch attempt
  against Amazon's own IR/blog domains 404'd. Verify at 07-30 earnings.
