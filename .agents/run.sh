#
# THIS FILE IS YOURS. It is rendered from the engine's canonical template so
# every repo starts identical, but it lives here, it is stamped here, and you
# may change it — the same relationship your publish adapter has with the
# engine's publish core. If your repo needs a different invocation, edit it
# and let it report as diverged; that is the system working, not a fault.
#
# ⚠️ The cron line deliberately carries NOTHING but a time and a skill name.
# Everything about HOW this repo runs lives in here, so evolving the
# invocation never means regenerating anyone's crontab.

#
# ⚠️ `--permission-mode auto` is REQUIRED, not a convenience (Ben,
# 2026-08-14): anything stricter stalls partway through /start and /daily,
# and a run that cannot finish is worse than no run — it leaves the repo
# half-swept with no published output. The same reasoning covers the
# publish: a /daily that stops short of publishing means the site never
# goes live, which is the entire point of running it on a schedule.
#
# So permissions are NOT the safety surface here. Two other things are, and
# both hold regardless of permission mode:
#
#   * SCOPE — `--add-dir` names this repo and its site sibling, and nothing
#     else. An unattended run can do this instance's own work; it cannot
#     wander into the engine or a sibling corpus.
#   * THE PUBLISH CORE'S OWN GUARANTEES — secret scan, field allowlist, and
#     the no-empty-wipe guard, which is precisely the unattended failure
#     worth fearing: a run that collects nothing must never wipe the live
#     site back to empty. Those are mechanical and cannot be skipped by an
#     adapter or a permission flag.
#
# And the receipt below is the third leg: a failed 3am run is detectable
# the next morning rather than invisible.
