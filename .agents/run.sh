# and let it report as diverged; that is the system working, not a fault.

# ── cron's PATH is not your PATH ────────────────────────────────────────────
# The single most common way a runner that works by hand fails on a schedule.
# cron gives a job `PATH=/usr/bin:/bin` and nothing else, so an agent CLI
# installed under a user prefix — npm's ~/.npm-global/bin, ~/.local/bin, a
# version manager's shim — is simply not found, and the job dies at 3am with
# "command not found" into a log nobody is reading.
#
# Resolve it here rather than baking an absolute path into the cron line: the
# binary can move (a reinstall, a version bump) without anyone having to
# regenerate a crontab, which is the same reasoning that keeps the cron line
# down to a time and a skill name.
# Written as an `if` for readability rather than out of necessity: a bare
# `[ -d x ] && ...` is ALSO safe here, because `set -e` exempts a command
# that is part of an `&&` list, and that exemption covers the enclosing
# loop. (Checked by running it, 2026-08-15, after asserting the opposite.)

# meaning anything, and a `/wrap` doing a scoped add can sweep a day of logs
# into a commit.

# A directory-local .gitignore rather than a line in the repo's root one: the
# root .gitignore belongs to the repo, is not a kit artifact, and editing it
# from the engine would be writing to a file kestrel does not own. This file
# ignores its own directory, needs no cooperation from anybody, and heals

# The trailing `|| true` is load-bearing, not defensive habit: `ls` exits 2
# when its glob matches nothing, which is precisely a repo's FIRST scheduled
# run, and `set -o pipefail` promotes that to a fatal error before the run
# starts. Found by running this file under a stripped cron-like environment
# on 2026-08-15 — it exits 2 with no output, so it would have failed silently
# at 09:00 and looked like cron never fired.

# Headless, non-interactive, from the repo root.
#
# ⚠️ `--permission-mode auto` is REQUIRED, not a convenience (Ben,
# 2026-08-14): anything stricter stalls partway through /start and /daily,
# and a run that cannot finish is worse than no run — it leaves the repo
# half-swept with no published output. The same reasoning covers the
# publish: a /daily that stops short of publishing means the site never
# goes live, which is the entire point of running it on a schedule.
#
# So permissions are NOT the safety surface here. Two other things are, and
# both hold regardless of permission mode:
#
#   * SCOPE — `--add-dir` names this repo and its site sibling, and nothing
#     else. An unattended run can do this instance's own work; it cannot
#     wander into the engine or a sibling corpus.
#   * THE PUBLISH CORE'S OWN GUARANTEES — secret scan, field allowlist, and
#     the no-empty-wipe guard, which is precisely the unattended failure
#     worth fearing: a run that collects nothing must never wipe the live
#     site back to empty. Those are mechanical and cannot be skipped by an
#     adapter or a permission flag.
#
# And the receipt below is the third leg: a failed 3am run is detectable
# the next morning rather than invisible.

# ── Leave a receipt ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The point of the receipt is that `kestrel fleet status` can read it and say
# "this repo's 14:00 daily has failed two days running". Without it, an
# unattended failure is invisible until someone notices the output missing.
#
# `dirty` is the second thing it has to record, and it exists because exit
# status alone LIED. A real unattended run announced it would wait for a
# backgrounded sweep, ended the turn on that sentence, never reached its
# commit step — and exited 0, because the CLI did shut down cleanly after
# printing it. `exit=0 dirty=46` is distinguishable from success; `exit=0`
# on its own is not. This runner's own logs and receipts do not inflate the
# count: they live under a directory it .gitignores itself.
# ⚠️ Guarded, not inlined, and this script has paid for the lesson once
# already. `set -o pipefail` is on, so ANY failing command in a `$(...)`
# assignment aborts the whole run — and it aborts it HERE, after the work
# is done and before the receipt is written, which is the worst possible
# place. The 2026-08-15 fix hit exactly this shape with the log-prune `ls`
# on an empty glob; writing it inline reintroduced it for a target that is
# not a git repo. `?` is a real answer: "not recorded" is not "clean".
