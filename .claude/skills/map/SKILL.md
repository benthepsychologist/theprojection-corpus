description: Read-only status card of the attention map and pipeline — lenses, thread freshness, radar modes, last digest, open gates. Safe any time.

# /map — where the watching stands

Read-only; run any number of times. Renders one compact card:

- **Lenses** — per lens: orgs / people / themes counts (from
  `attention/watchlist.yaml`), release-watch + conditions where present.
- **Threads by freshness** — 🟢 fresh (`last_seen` ≤ 3d) · 🟡 aging (≤ 10d) ·
  🔴 stale (> 10d — will hit the next `/week` decay review); resolved count.
- **Board** (`attention/board.yaml`) — actor counts by kind (states /
  kingdoms; the `regulator`/`route-layer` stubs), Houses count, any org
  still carrying a `# provisional` posture (a `/classify postures`
  candidate), and the most recent kind change if any. (Actors differ by the
  capitalization/optionality/gravity axes, not a rank ladder — 2026-07-25.)
- **Radar** — each question: mode (answer/monitor/both) + one-line state;
  flag questions with no working notes in 30+ days.
- **Pipeline** — last daily per lens (date + building/final + coverage
  state), last weekly, last delivery/feedback pull.
- **Gates & flags** — anything ⛔ in BOOTSTRAP.md, sources with `at-risk`
  status in `sources/sources.yaml`.

No writes, no network needed (state is all on disk). End with the single
most useful next action (e.g. "yesterday never finalized — run /daily").
