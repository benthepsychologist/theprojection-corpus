description: Session-bootstrap card for an attention instance — fuses the generic continuation ritual (docs, memory, git log) with the attention pipeline's live state (digest status, expectations due, flash rail, freshness, push safety). Read-only; run at the start of any session.

# /start — pick up the attention pipeline where it was left

This is the attention-kind sibling of `registry/start`, not a generic
skill every instance shares — an attention instance's session state lives
in digests, expectations, and a flash rail; a registry instance's lives in
candidates, records, and changelog. Split into two kind-specific skills
(2026-07-31) after therapybulletin (the first registry instance) surfaced
that this file's "generic continuation ritual" framing was aspirational,
not actual: every pipeline-state step below was already attention-shaped,
so pretending it was `common/` just meant a registry instance either got
sections that didn't apply or had to route around them by hand. The kit
renderer resolves this file for any instance whose `kestrel.yaml` declares
`kind: attention` (KITS.md §2's family selection); registry instances get
`registry/start` instead, same slash name, different family, no collision.

Generic `/life:start` (docs + memory + git log) doesn't know kestrel has a
live pipeline underneath it; `/map` knows the pipeline but says nothing
about session continuity or repo hygiene. `/start` runs both passes and
renders one card, in this order:

1. **Continuation briefing** — read the canonical docs at repo root
   (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `STATUS.md`, `README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`; say
   plainly if one is missing rather than silently skipping it), then this
   project's persistent memory directory (`MEMORY.md` + every file it
   links, in full — standing preferences and prior feedback that won't
   show up in the repo's own docs). Then `git log --oneline` since
   STATUS.md's own "As of" date (or `-20`, whichever is more informative),
   `git status --short`, and the tail of `log.md` (kestrel's own
   session-close ledger, AGENTS.md §Session close — distinct from git's
   commit-message view: it says what ran, what surfaced, where to pick up,
   in prose git log doesn't carry). Frame the synthesis around
   continuation: what changed last, what's still open, what's next — not
   a raw dump of any of the four reads.
2. **Digest state** — read `artifacts/digests/daily/`, newest files first,
   for each lens's frontmatter (`status: building|final`,
   `coverage: na|pending|done`). Is today's digest curated? Is yesterday
   finalized? Apply `/daily`'s own finalization rule rather than
   re-deriving one here: a day only finalizes once its coverage is
   checkable, ~5h past its close (`/daily` SKILL.md intro + step 1) — a
   `building`/`pending` digest less than ~5h old is expected, not a gap.
3. **Expectations due** — read `attention/upcoming.yaml`. Surface every
   `pending` entry due today or tomorrow, and anything already
   `passed-silent` (within its 3-day grace or past it) — AGENTS.md
   discipline 7 calls a silently-passed date **the loud outcome**; report
   it as a finding, not a footnote. Use the same status vocabulary
   `/daily` step 2 checks against (`pending → hit | slipped |
   passed-silent`) rather than inventing a second one — this command only
   *reads* the ledger, it never flips a status.
4. **Flash rail** — read `attention/flash.yaml`. Anything active
   (`expires` in the future)? Per AGENTS.md discipline 10 / `/daily` step
   4, only `severity: critical` belongs on the rail and normally at most
   one is active — flag it if two are live (exceptional) or if anything
   non-critical snuck in.
5. **Freshness + decay** — thread freshness uses the exact bucketing
   `/map` already defines (🟢 fresh ≤3d · 🟡 aging ≤10d · 🔴 stale >10d,
   by `last_seen`) — see that skill's SKILL.md for the read; don't
   re-derive it here, just apply it and list what's 🔴 today. Then: newest
   file in `artifacts/digests/weekly/` (or the latest week-scorecard line
   in `coverage-log.md`) for when `/week` last ran; newest
   `provenance/publish-*.yaml` timestamp for when `/publish` last ran.
6. **Push safety** — run `git log @{u}..` in **both** `/workspace/kestrel`
   and `/workspace/theprojection-site`. This is the one check `/map` doesn't
   do and it's load-bearing: AGENTS.md §Session close documents that
   `/publish --push` pushes theprojection's deploy hook and **nothing**
   ever pushes kestrel automatically, so unpushed kestrel commits
   accumulate silently across sessions (found once at 17 commits deep,
   inherited across two closed sessions). **A clean `git status` is not
   evidence of this** — only `git log @{u}..` is. If either repo has
   unpushed commits, that's the headline flag of the whole card, not a
   footnote at the bottom.
7. **Doc drift check** — compare STATUS.md's own "As of" date and its top
   note's claims against the commits since that date (already in hand
   from step 1's git log). Flag anything the top note asserts that the
   newest commits have already overtaken; fix nothing — just name the
   drift. Not hypothetical: earlier the same day on 2026-07-29, STATUS's
   top note still said `sev=`/`flash.yaml` were unwired and theprojection
   was unpushed, when both had already shipped in commits sitting right
   above it.
8. **Name the obvious next move** — one plain line, e.g. "07-28 is
   finalizable, run `/daily`" or "nothing due, good window for the P3
   judgment tools" — don't leave it for the reader to infer from the
   briefing above it.

## Rules

1. **Read-only, always.** `/start` never edits `attention/`, never writes
   an artifact, never commits, never publishes — same guarantee `/map`
   states explicitly. It only reads: repo-root docs, the memory directory,
   git (log/status, both repos), `log.md`, `artifacts/digests/daily/`,
   `attention/upcoming.yaml`, `attention/flash.yaml`, `attention/
   threads.yaml` (via `/map`'s freshness read), `artifacts/digests/weekly/`,
   `coverage-log.md`, and `provenance/publish-*.yaml`.
2. **Reuse, don't duplicate.** Where `/map` or `/daily` already specifies
   how to read a file or compute a state (thread freshness buckets, the
   digest finalization rule, the expectations status vocabulary), point at
   that command's section instead of writing a second recipe that can
   drift out of sync with it.
3. Formatting follows the same house style as every other skill card:
   one-line verdict up top, bullets with bold lead terms, a table wherever
   facts enumerate cleanly (digest status by lens, expectations due),
   status emojis as anchors, a horizontal rule between the major sections
   above.
4. If nothing is wrong anywhere in the card, say that plainly — a clean
   `/start` is a real, useful finding, not a step to pad out.
