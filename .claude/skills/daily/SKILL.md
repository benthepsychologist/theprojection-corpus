# /daily — catch up to now

The core loop turn. **Run ANY time, as often as wanted** (Ben, 2026-07-28:
"the times on the clock are arbitrary — /daily just updates us to
current"). A run brings the record up to the present: reconstruct any
missed days, finalize every day that's finalizable, open/extend the
current day. Re-runs rebuild in place; there is no scheduled hour and no
market-close ritual.

Two invariants survive the de-scheduling (they're about data, not clocks):
- **The 5am-ET digest-day boundary stays** — it buckets items into days
  for the archive; it never dictates when you run.
- **A day finalizes only when its coverage is checkable** — the critic's
  benchmark publications appear mid-morning, so a day flips to
  `final/coverage: done` only once the run happens ≥ ~5h after that day
  closed. A too-fresh day stays `building/coverage: pending` and the next
  run (whenever it is) finishes it. This is the old "after 10:00 ET" rule
  relocated from run-gate to per-day condition — recall is preserved
  without gating the operator.

**Digest-day = 5am ET → 5am ET** (DST-aware, zoneinfo). **Week = the 7
digest-days Mon…Sun** (fixed, regardless of when `/week` runs). States live
in each digest's frontmatter: `status: building|final`,
`coverage: na|pending|done` — the state machine is what makes
run-anytime safe: every day's standing is in its own frontmatter, so a
run just advances whatever is advanceable.

**The frame (Ben, 2026-07-22):** the product is a rolling weekly report —
"what's happening this week + what changed today" — built from threads and
entities, not a daily in a vacuum. The per-day digests remain the canonical
archive; the page is derived from them.

## Steps

1. **Finalize yesterday — and EVERY missed day since the last run** (Ben,
   2026-07-27: "a week shouldn't be worse because a Thursday or Friday run
   didn't happen"). If digest-days are missing between the last daily and
   yesterday (weekends included — the 07-20 week's four biggest stories all
   broke Fri-night→Sun with no daily running), reconstruct each gap day:
   a per-day sweep of its window, a digest marked *reconstructed* in its
   *Curated from* line, timeline entries with that day's `⟨daily <date>⟩`
   markers. Then finalize as normal (if `building` or `coverage: pending`):
   re-collect the precise final window, re-curate as the definitive
   day-in-review, run the **coverage critic** vs. `sources/benchmarks.yaml`
   — appendix + `coverage-log.md` entry + guardrail-protected
   watchlist/thread auto-adds. Fold late/critic-caught items into
   yesterday's timeline blocks (`⟨daily <yesterday>⟩` markers) with
   `<!-- k: -->` annotations. A **Sunday-evening mini-sweep** (a light
   collect-only pass, no full curation) is sanctioned any weekend to cut
   the Monday reconstruction load.
2. **Upcoming check** (before collect, so the sweep can target due claims) —
   read `attention/upcoming.yaml`; for every `pending` entry with
   `due <= today` (plus `passed-silent` within its 3-day grace), sweep for
   confirming/slipping evidence. Flip statuses: evidence → `hit` · new date
   → `slipped` (old date onto `slips:`, back to `pending`) · neither →
   `passed-silent` (**the loud outcome**). Every flip is a line in the
   digest's ⏳ section.
3. **Collect today-so-far** — full sweep: feeds + query sweep over
   `attention/watchlist.yaml` terms and open `attention/threads.yaml`
   terms, per lens. Buffer results (30-day retention) with
   `threads`/`entities` slug arrays; write per-run provenance manifests.
4. **Curate + tag** — one digest per lens into `artifacts/digests/daily/`,
   against `templates/daily-digest.md`. Rubric unchanged (frame-neutral ·
   signal over noise · watchlist priority · de-dupe vs. prior digest · drop
   Reddit/PR-newswire · trim GDELT finance-bleed/arXiv · empty input stated
   plainly), plus six duties — the sixth is **global-capital only**, not a
   rewrite of the shared five (DESIGN.md Part 2 §8):
   - **annotate every bullet** with `<!-- k: t=… e=… axis=… -->` (entity
     slugs only from the watchlist — a new entity = a map add first; 0–3
     threads per item);
   - **mark magnitude with `sev=`** on the annotation where it applies
     (`sev=major`, rarely `sev=flash`) — this is the M term in the
     salience score (AGENTS discipline 10). **The default is no `sev=` at
     all.** `major` is for a development that genuinely resets a thread —
     a resolution, a reversal, a first-of-its-kind — not for the day's
     best story, which the throughline already carries. If more than
     roughly one item a day is getting `sev=`, the bar has drifted and
     the term stops discriminating.
   - **rebuild today's timeline block** at the top of
     `artifacts/threads/<slug>.md` for each thread with a real development
     (per `templates/thread-timeline.md`; ambient matches only update
     `last_seen`);
   - **log new dated expectations** into `upcoming.yaml`
     (`logged_by: curate-add`).
   - **ask once whether the day warrants a FLASH** — `attention/flash.yaml`,
     the rail that publishes on every page of the site. The test is NOT
     "is this our biggest story" (the executive summary carries that); it
     is **"would this lead a general news front page — 9/11, an invasion,
     a market-halting crash — whether or not it touches our lenses?"**
     (Ben, 2026-07-29). **`critical` only reaches the rail; normally at
     most one is active**, two is exceptional. Same primary-source
     discipline as everything else — a wrong flash is worse than a late
     one, and an unverified one says so on its face. **A flash lives 24
     hours and that is ENFORCED IN CODE** (Ben, 2026-08-04: "24h and
     gone") — `render_read.flash_last_day()` renders it on its filing day
     and no longer. So **do NOT set `expires` to buy extra days: a value
     longer than the filing day is ignored, not honoured.** `expires` can
     only SHORTEN. When catching a LATE event, set `filed:` to today so its
     24h runs from the catch rather than from the event you missed. If a
     story still warrants the rail tomorrow, that means a NEW event
     happened — file a new flash for it, per the
     new-event-never-a-running-state rule. **Most days have no flash, and
     writing none is the correct outcome** — the rail is worthless if it
     fires often.
   - **write the cross-lens executive summary** to
     `artifacts/digests/daily/<date>-front.md` — a `## Today's throughline`
     section in the digests' **neutral register** (not first person),
     saying what the day amounted to across all three lenses. It is
     parsed for that section only. Stage 1 of the summary ladder: bullets
     are deliberately not hand-written, because deriving them from the
     salience ranking is stage 2 (ROADMAP §Salience).
   - **global-capital only: attach an `interpretation` where a real
     mechanism is identifiable** — never forced onto every bullet to pad a
     thin day (Ben, 2026-07-30: "it's not just aggregating news items,
     it's reviewing them through this lens and offering possible
     interpretations"). Read `attention/capital-context.yaml` (the
     standing snapshot) first — the interpretation answers "how does this
     interact with the current picture," not "what do I think from
     nothing." Shape: `{mechanism, confidence, scenarios[{direction, why,
     precedent?}], context_note}` — `theprojection readouts`'s
     `validate_interpretation()` enforces it, same discipline as every
     other shape here: above `speculative` confidence, at least one
     scenario needs a real precedent or the whole thing is rejected, not
     waved through. Write it to the sidecar
     `artifacts/digests/daily/<date>-global-capital.interp.yaml`, keyed by
     `slugify()` of the bullet's own **bold lead phrase** (its own
     dedicated key namespace — NOT the item `id` field, which is
     URL-based when a source link exists and only falls back to a text
     slug otherwise; the interpretation key is always the bold-phrase
     slug, unconditionally, so it stays stable regardless of whether the
     bullet carries a link), and mark the bullet's `<!-- k: ... -->`
     annotation with `interp=yes` so the renderer knows to look it up.
     Full spec: DESIGN.md Part 2.
5. **Map deltas + thread candidates** — the digest's 🔄 Map changes section
   (every edit since the last daily, provenance-tagged) + **1–3 thread
   candidates** ("track this?"; unanswered candidates reappear once, then
   drop). Two pools feed the same 1–3 slots, not additive on top of them
   (World News stays restrained — "on the radar, not drowning out my real
   targets," ROADMAP §World News):
   - **curator-noticed** — a story surfaced during collect/curate that
     isn't mechanically scored, judgment-picked as usual.
   - **`attention/world-news.yaml`'s `candidate`-status items** (built by
     `theprojection build-world-news`, wiring GDELT + google_news_rss) — these
     already cleared a real outlet/domain-count bar and failed to match
     any existing thread, so they're pre-qualified, not raw noise. Offer
     the highest-`distinct_outlets` ones first; tag the line
     `(world-news, N outlets)` per the template's `(source)` convention so
     it reads as mechanically-scored, not a curator guess. Check
     yesterday's digest's own Thread candidates section first — if the
     same story was already offered and Ben didn't act on it, don't
     re-offer it a second time (the file regenerates fresh each run, so
     "already offered" isn't tracked in the YAML itself, only in the
     digest archive). A candidate Ben promotes becomes a real thread the
     normal way (`ben-steer`, `/steer`); once that thread's terms/watch
     text exist, the next `build_world_news.py` run matches the same
     story to it automatically and it drops out of the candidate pool on
     its own — no extra bookkeeping needed.
5b. **Refresh the standing synthesis** — for any board actor that *moved*
   today (a new/updated thread, a posture/rank change), re-write its
   `attention/actor-doing.yaml` "what are they doing now" roll-up and bump
   `asof`. Light touch — only the actors that moved; `/week` does the full
   pass. (The synthesis shows atop each `/map/<slug>/` page.)
6. ⛔ **RETIRED 2026-08-25 (Ben: "that predates the actual website... kill
   it utterly")** — this step used to run `theprojection render-read` and
   republish the private Artifact-hosted "internal read" page
   (`artifacts/read/index.html`, the stable URL in the old ROADMAP.md
   §Delivery). It predated `theprojection.org` (the real public site) and
   had become dead weight: a repeated >600KB soft-cap/Artifact-refusal
   fight every run, for a reader nobody was using once the site existed.
   `render_read.py`'s helper functions are NOT retired — `readouts.py` and
   `publish/adapter.py` still import from it for the step below, which is
   now the actual render+publish step every `/daily` run does. Do not
   re-add a render-read call here without checking those two callers.
6a. **Refresh the public site's briefings** (Ben, 2026-07-30: they'd gone
    stale mid-day and one had gone missing after a lens rename — "it
    should be additive... have it update in place whenever new things
    show up"). `theprojection readouts --scan` covers 165 scopes (front + 3
    lenses + every thread/entity/node), but only **front + the 3 lens
    scopes carry the fuller briefing** (`briefing_scope()`) and only
    those render on the public site's front/beat pages — that's the
    routine part of every `/daily` run:
    `--pack front`, `--pack lens:ai`, `--pack lens:global-capital`,
    `--pack lens:mental-health`, one sonnet-class agent per pack (they
    run independently — dispatch in parallel), each returning
    `{gist, lead, sections, watch}` per the pack's own embedded `shape`
    field. Assemble the four into one `{scope: {briefing: {...}}}` JSON
    and run `--apply` — it validates (including the `LINK_FLOOR`: ≥60%
    of bullets need a real url once ≥3 are on offer; add `/threads/
    <slug>/` links rather than leaving bullets unlinked) and rejects
    anything malformed rather than storing it. Then `--export` (also
    mechanically drops any scope key orphaned by a rename — e.g.
    `lens:money` after the Global Capital rename — so a renamed lens
    never sits invisible under its old key). `/publish --push` ships the
    refreshed store to the site (`data/readouts.json`). The other ~150
    thread/entity/node summary scopes are a separate, larger backlog —
    not part of this routine step; refresh those only when asked.
7. **Take steering** — Ben's reactions ("track X", "drop Y", "deeper on Z",
   "expect C by D") apply immediately as `ben-steer` edits (see `/steer`).
   End by stating what changed in the map today.
8. **Close the session** — `OPERATING.md` §6: append to `log.md`, then
   **commit and push THIS repo** (`git push origin $(git rev-parse
   --abbrev-ref HEAD)`), including this run's provenance manifests.
   ⛔ **Never push `kestrel`** — it is out of this session's write
   zone; flag it, never fix it.
   this repo — nothing else does, so a run that skips this leaves work
   sitting local and looking fine. Check `git log @{u}..` before calling
   it done.

## Interim mode — the dispatch plan (Ben, 2026-07-28: "dispatch a bunch
## of agents… otherwise updates take forever with all these threads")

Until `collectors/` land (BOOTSTRAP §Building), collection is agentic —
and at 50+ threads it is TIERED, fired as ONE parallel batch at run
start, curated by this session as reports land. News arrives by STORY;
threads consume by ROUTING — so never dispatch per-thread (the same
story would be fetched 58 times). Three tiers:

1. **Lens sweeps — COLLECTORS FIRST (2026-07-28: collectors/ is real):**
   run `cloud-researcher collect --corpus .` (all lenses, since last run) BEFORE any
   agent — 7 deterministic sources (google_news_rss, rss, gdelt,
   sec_edgar, federal_register, openalex, clinicaltrials) fill buffer/ +
   provenance in minutes, free. Then AT MOST 1-2 sonnet agents to cover
   what collectors can't (paywalled bodies, follow-up questions) — not
   broad sweeps. Curation routes buffered items to 0-3 threads.
2. **Hot-cluster deep checks (2-4 agents):** threads that are (a) DUE
   today per `upcoming.yaml`, (b) weight-3, or (c) moved in the last
   48h — grouped into clusters by meta-parent + entity family (the capex
   tree · the financing loop · grok/musk · china stack · memory · the
   payer bloc · …), 5-8 threads per agent. Depth goes where the map says
   it's needed today.
3. **Cold rotation (1 agent):** the quiet tail on a 7-day rotation —
   ~1/7th of cold threads per run get a targeted term-sweep, so every
   thread is touched at least weekly at near-zero daily cost. `/week`'s
   decay review audits what the rotation missed.

Operating rules (distilled from real failures, 07-27/28):
- **WebSearch budget is reserved for tier 2.** Tiers 1 and 3 run
  RSS/WebFetch-first (Google News RSS is reliable for headline+date).
- **Date-of-event claims need a primary-source check before a timeline
  entry** — aggregation re-indexes masquerade as fresh news (the
  SpaceX-misdate + apple-gemini false-positive lessons).
- **Write scopes are disjoint:** an agent may write ONLY its assigned
  threads' timeline files + its own finding/bundle. `threads.yaml`,
  `upcoming.yaml`, `actor-doing.yaml` are main-session-only — agents
  PROPOSE updates in their reports.
- **Tier-1/tier-2 overlap is a feature, not waste** — cross-sweep
  contradiction is the error detector (it caught the SpaceX date).
- Scale check: ~6-9 agents per run, growing with CLUSTER count, not
  thread count.
- **A silent sweep gets re-dispatched, not waited on indefinitely.** A
  transcript file's size/mtime look identical whether an agent is working
  normally or permanently stalled — the motivating case was a declined
  tool call causing a 2+ hour stall with zero signal. If one dispatch in
  a batch has been silent for several multiples of its sibling
  dispatches' typical return time, don't keep guessing: re-dispatch that
  lens/cluster fresh, and mark its lens's window UNREAD in the digest
  rather than inferring a result that never landed. If the original,
  late-running agent's response DOES eventually show up, reconcile it
  against whatever the re-dispatch produced — don't just discard it, it
  may still hold real findings the re-dispatch missed.

Curated by this session against the same templates. Same contract as the
future pipeline — say "agentic-interim" in the digest's *Curated from*
line. Step 6 (the internal read page) is retired — `theprojection readouts`
(step 6a) is the real render+publish path now; never hand-assemble a page.
