# /steer <utterance> — move the map

The lowest-friction write path. Ben speaks; the map moves; every edit is
logged. Examples:

- `/steer track Ksana Health under mental-health` → watchlist org add
- `/steer drop Pear Therapeutics, it's dead` → watchlist removal
- `/steer thread: UHS-Talkspace close` → new thread (drafted from context,
  shown before saving; timeline file seeded in `artifacts/threads/`)
- `/steer resolve gpt-5.6-release` → thread status flip (+ closing timeline
  entry)
- `/steer deeper on ai-circular-financing-risk` → hand off to `/crawl`
- `/steer ask: is anyone actually auditing therapy chatbots?` → new radar Q
- `/steer expect Gemini 3.5 Pro by Aug 15` → `upcoming.yaml` add
  (`logged_by: ben-steer`)
- `/steer slip deepseek-v4-stable to 07-31` · `/steer confirm cxmt-star-listing`
  → expectation status flips
- `/steer entity "Elon Musk xAI" is elon-musk` → watchlist mapping-form edit
- `/steer weight kaiser-ai-clinician-backlash 3` → thread importance (1–3;
  amplifies move-size in the read's ranking)
- `/steer tag the SoftBank fee story to stargate-buildout` → digest
  annotation + timeline fix
- `/steer set posture openai expanding` → board org posture (drops the
  `# provisional` marker)
- `/steer set cap openai constrained ~$60B` · `/steer set gravity nvidia
  ...` → set an actor's axis estimate (capitalization/optionality/gravity)
- `/steer move china to state` → **kind change (an event — loud, logged,
  thread offered; never silent)**
- `/steer set condition apple in-succession` · `/steer clear condition
  meta-ai under-review` → board condition on an org
- `/steer set genre red-sea-oil-shock exogenous-shock` → thread genre
- `/steer add house "Masayoshi Son"; holds softbank` → new board House +
  its held realm (`held_by` on the org)
- `/steer add actor "Perplexity" as kingdom, sphere us` → new board org
  (adds to watchlist too if sweepable)

## Board verbs (`attention/board.yaml`)

The board is part of the map — these edits go to `attention/board.yaml`
(the neutral power layer), same low-friction/provenance discipline as the
rest. Two things are specific to the board:

- **Neutral kinds only.** Write the slug (`kingdom`, `hedging`,
  `in-succession`), never a costume word — the vocabulary is projected on
  the site (`data/labels.yaml`), not stored here. Actors are differentiated
  by the **axes** (capitalization/optionality/gravity), not a rank ladder —
  the ladder was removed 2026-07-25 (see `/classify` for the model).
- **A change of kind is an EVENT, never silent** (§8.5). Moving an actor
  state↔kingdom shows the change, logs it prominently to `coverage-log.md`,
  and **offers to open a thread** for it. Don't apply a kind edit without
  surfacing it. (A big axis re-estimate is worth the same treatment.)
- The `held_by` pointer lives on the org (derive a House's holdings by
  inversion); `depends_on` (the dependency stub — still written `liege`
  until the rename lands) lives on the dependent. Never a `holds:`/`vassals:`
  list on the other side.
- For a *judgment* call (what kind? what posture? what's its axis profile?)
  reach for `/classify` instead — it proposes and reasons. `/steer` board
  verbs are for edits you've already decided.

After any board edit, **republish**: `/publish --push` regenerates
`data/board.json` so the `/map/` pages reflect it.

## Global Capital verbs (`attention/capital-context.yaml`)

- `/steer capital-context emphasize <thing>` → adds to `framing.emphasis[]`
- `/steer capital-context deprioritize <thing>` → adds to `framing.deprioritize[]`
- `/steer capital-context note: <freeform instruction>` → replaces
  `framing.notes`

**These touch `framing` ONLY** (Ben, 2026-07-30: "manual steer allowed to
adjust the parameters by which the global context is built or framed") —
`/steer` never hand-edits a `readings.*.value` directly. `framing` steers
what the *next* refresh pass emphasizes or drops; the readings themselves
are machine-derived from the data stack (Treasury TIC/BIS/IMF/EPFR/fund-
flow reports) on their own weekly, `/week`-adjacent cadence (DESIGN.md
Part 2 §11). If a reading is simply wrong (a bad pull, a stale figure),
that's a data/collector bug — flag it plainly rather than silently
overwriting the value through `/steer`.

## Rules

1. Parse the utterance into one or more concrete edits to
   `attention/{watchlist.yaml,threads.yaml,upcoming.yaml,radar.md,board.yaml}`
   (and, for thread/tag edits, the matching `artifacts/threads/<slug>.md` —
   timeline corrections carry `⟨steer YYYY-MM-DD⟩`). Show anything
   non-obvious (a drafted thread, a reworded question, a rank change)
   before writing.
2. Tag every edit `# ben-steer YYYY-MM-DD` (inline comment or notes line)
   and append one line to `coverage-log.md` under today's date: what
   changed and the words that caused it.
3. **YAML guardrail:** after any edit, `yaml.safe_load` every touched YAML
   file; on failure `git checkout --` the file and retry.
4. Ambiguous utterance → ask one short question, don't guess a deletion.
   Additions may be guessed liberally (EDGE-inclusive); deletions never.
5. Commit with a `steer:` prefix message.

These edits surface automatically in the next daily's 🔄 Map changes section.
