# /week — synthesis + decay review

Once a week (Saturday by default; any convenient day works). **The week is
fixed Mon–Sun (5am ET boundaries)** — `week_of` is the Monday of the week
containing the run date, regardless of which day `/week` actually runs.
This is where the map *shrinks* and understanding *compounds*; the dailies
only ever grow it.

## Steps

1. **Weekly digest** — one per lens into `artifacts/digests/weekly/`,
   rendered against `templates/weekly-digest.md`. Written **against
   `attention/radar.md` questions**, not as a re-aggregation: what moved on
   each open Q this week, reading the week's dailies as pre-digested
   history plus one fresh 7-day sweep.
2. **Expectations scorecard** — resolve anything in
   `attention/upcoming.yaml` still pending-but-due from the week; write the
   week's hit/slipped/passed-silent scorecard into the weekly digest
   (⏳ section); prune resolved entries older than the closing week (the
   digest records them first — nothing is lost). **Also prune expired
   flashes** from `attention/flash.yaml` — expired means past
   `render_read.flash_last_day()` (the filing day; **not** the raw
   `expires` field, which since 2026-08-04 can only shorten a flash and is
   ignored when longer). This is now cosmetic tidying: the rail already
   refuses to render them regardless. Their substance already lives in the
   digests and timelines; nothing is lost. If the week logged
   **more than one or two flashes, say so in the digest** — a rail that
   fires often has a drifting bar and stops meaning anything
   (AGENTS discipline 10).
3. **Near-miss audit** — the week's `coverage-log.md` entries: what
   benchmarks led with that we missed, what was auto-added, whether a
   *pattern* implies a watchlist/source gap. Also flag: any entity with
   heavy item traffic but no thread (candidate signal) and any thread whose
   tags never appear (retire signal).
4. **Decay review** — threads whose `last_seen` is older than **10 days**
   as prune candidates (slug · stale since · keep/resolve/retire · why),
   plus **stale timelines** (thread active in yaml but no timeline entry in
   14 days) and unresolved passed-silent expectations. **Ben answers in the
   same read**; apply as `decay-review` edits. Never retire silently.
   **Board pass** (2026-07-24; axis model 2026-07-25): run the `/classify
   postures` logic — propose a posture for every org marked `# provisional`
   or whose posture no longer matches its open-thread genres, flag any actor
   whose structural kind (state↔kingdom) or axis estimate
   (capitalization/optionality/gravity) has drifted from the evidence, and
   surface board actors with no live thread this cycle as `dormant`
   candidates. Ben confirms in the same read;
   apply `classify`/`ben-steer`. **Then refresh the standing synthesis** — a
   full pass over `attention/actor-doing.yaml`, re-writing each major actor's
   "what are they doing now" roll-up from its current threads + posture (bump
   `asof`); this is the layer people read to know an actor's state without
   reading every thread. Then `/publish --push` so `/map/` reflects it all.
4b. **Refresh the standing capital-context snapshot**
   (`attention/capital-context.yaml`, DESIGN.md Part 2 §11) — this is the
   `/week`-adjacent pass that artifact is built for; `/daily` never
   touches it. Re-run the Global Capital data stack's 5 collectors
   (`treasury_tic`, `bis_stats`, `imf_data`, `epfr_flows`,
   `fund_flow_reports` — `KESTREL_INSTANCE=/workspace/theprojection-corpus python3 /workspace/kestrel/tools/collect.py --lens global-capital
   --source <id>` per source, since these aren't part of the term-swept
   watchlist sweep), then re-write each `readings.*` entry from what
   actually came back — a real value, a real `basis`, real `sources[]`,
   bump `as_of`. Apply `framing.emphasis`/`framing.deprioritize`/
   `framing.notes` (whatever `/steer capital-context ...` has accumulated
   since the last refresh) to shape which readings get the closer look,
   same as any other steering input. A reading with genuinely nothing new
   since last week (the data hasn't moved — several of these sources lag
   weeks to months) keeps its prior value and `as_of` rather than being
   rewritten for the sake of it. Never hand-invent a reading — if a
   collector comes back empty (`fund_flow_reports` may well, both its
   sources are bot-gated as of 2026-07-30), say so in the reading's
   `value` rather than fabricating one.
5. **Radar upkeep** — update each worked question's Working notes; flag any
   question that looks answered or dead.
6. **Map deltas of the week** — the full add/drop ledger with provenance
   tags, so evolution stays visible.
7. **Re-render the page** — run `tools/render_read.py` and republish so the
   synthesis panel (`weekly`) appears on the read for the rest of the week;
   at the next Monday rollover it carries collapsed (`weekly_prior`)
   through Tuesday.
8. **Take steering** — same as `/daily`: reactions apply immediately.

## Interim mode

Until the pipeline lands, run the 7-day sweep agentically (subagent per
lens) and assemble against the template in-session.
