# /publish [--push] [--dry-run] — export to theprojection.org

Runs `kestrel publish --instance /workspace/theprojection-corpus`
(AGENTS.md discipline 9) — the generic engine CLI, which loads this repo's
own `publish/adapter.py` (declared in `kestrel.yaml`'s `outputs.adapter`).
Kestrel feeds the site; never the reverse, and no other path writes there.

**Not part of `/daily`** — this is a separate, deliberate step. `/daily`
only renders + republishes the private artifact page; nothing pushes to
the public site unless this command (or the script directly) runs.

## What it does

Every thread in `attention/threads.yaml` publishes unless flagged
`public: false` (an escape hatch, not a gate — see AGENTS.md disc. 9). For
each publishable thread: strips the internal header off its timeline
artifact, keeps only the hardcoded field allowlist (never `notes`, never
`terms`), and secret-scans the result. Also assembles this week's
throughlines/items/map-changes/upcoming-expectations into the site's
weekly payload, entity stub pages for everything actually referenced. A
zero-publishable-threads run is a no-op — it never wipes the live site.

## Modes

- **`/publish`** (default) — stages `content/threads/*.md`,
  `content/entities/*.md`, `data/payload.json` into the site repo's
  working tree. No commit, no push, no deploy. Good for reviewing a diff
  before it goes live.
- **`/publish --push`** — stages, then commits + pushes the site repo and
  fires the Cloudflare Workers Builds deploy hook. theprojection.org
  updates for real, immediately. **No confirmation needed** (Ben,
  2026-07-23: "there's no editorial here, pushing to live is basically
  costless — it's the primary read surface") — the safety already lives in
  the mechanical backstops below (secret-scan, field allowlist, the
  `public: false` escape hatch), not in asking before every push. Treat
  `--push` as the normal path.
- **`/publish --dry-run`** — reports what would publish (thread list +
  payload counts) without writing anything, staged or otherwise.

## Staleness check (added 2026-07-23, Ben: fold this into routine `/publish` work)

Before (or as part of) every `/publish` run, a **quick** fact-check —
bounded, not a full docs-sync pass:

1. **kestrel's own command lists** (`README.md`'s working-day block +
   layout table, `AGENTS.md`'s operating-rhythm table) list every skill
   actually in `.claude/skills/` — nothing added/renamed there silently.
2. **theprojection's public-facing claims about itself** — `content/about.md`
   and the site repo's own `README.md` — match how publishing actually
   works right now (AGENTS.md discipline 9: default-on, not hand-gated;
   `public: false` is an escape hatch, not an editorial review step). This
   is the drift that actually happened 2026-07-23: both files still said
   "reviewed by hand before publication," stale since the 07-22
   default-publish decision.
3. **kestrel's `STATUS.md`** "As of" line and the public-site status note
   reflect whether the site is actually live with real threads (not still
   describing an earlier scaffold/pre-launch state).

Fix drift inline (small, mechanical edits — not a rewrite) and report what
was corrected, if anything. Genuinely first-person content on the public
site (e.g. `about.md`'s "How I use it") gets drafted, not asserted —
flag it for Ben's read-through rather than treating it as finished. If
nothing's stale, say so plainly — that's a real, useful finding too, not
a step to skip silently.

## Rules

1. `--push` is the normal mode, not a special-caution one — don't ask
   before running it. If the ask is genuinely ambiguous about which mode
   (rare — usually "publish" means `--push`), default to `--push` rather
   than the more conservative stage-only.
2. A secret-scan hit on any single thread skips that thread (logged, not
   silently dropped); a hit on the *assembled weekly payload* aborts the
   entire run rather than publishing a partial, unscanned batch.
3. Report what ran: threads published, threads skipped (+ why), payload
   counts, and — if `--push` — the commit range and the Cloudflare
   build_uuid from the deploy-hook response.
4. This instance's own site-dir env var (named in its `.env.example`), or
   `--site-dir`, overrides the
   default site checkout path if it ever moves — set in **this repo's own
   `.env`**, not kestrel's (the adapter is instance-owned, revised
   2026-07-31).
5. **The deploy hook only fires automatically inside `kestrel publish --push`,**
   and only if this instance's deploy-hook env var is set — there's no
   fallback. Its exact name is declared in this repo's own `.env.example`;
   a shared template cannot know it (see `OPERATING.md` §1).
   Any *other* push to the site repo (a template/CSS/JS/code change, not a
   content publish) does **not** auto-trigger a Cloudflare build — fire it
   by hand: `curl -X POST "$<this repo's deploy-hook var>"`. Learned
   2026-07-23 doing the mobile-fix and copy-chat-feature pushes directly.
