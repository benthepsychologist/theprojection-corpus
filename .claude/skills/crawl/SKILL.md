# /crawl <thread-slug or topic> — backstory on demand

The "dive" in hover-and-dive. Depth is pulled when Ben wants it, never
pre-stocked.

## Steps

1. **Resolve the target** — a `threads.yaml` slug (use its terms + watch
   question) or a free topic (draft terms from it; offer to open a thread
   after).
2. **Crawl backwards** through the external SoT: GDELT (DOC API ≤ ~3 months;
   **BigQuery public dataset beyond** — authed, verified 2026-07-20),
   OpenAlex/Crossref for the research spine, EDGAR full-text for the money
   trail, CourtListener/Federal Register for the legal-regulatory arc, as
   the topic warrants. Subagent sweeps (sonnet-class) per source family;
   cite everything. **Pre-flight (added 2026-07-22 after a live misfire):**
   the session WebSearch budget is shared and may already be spent by the
   day's /daily sweeps — if a search-dependent agent reports budget
   exhaustion, don't retry it; re-dispatch on the API path (GDELT via curl
   with ~6s pacing + WebFetch of known/returned URLs + Federal
   Register/GovTrack APIs), which needs no WebSearch at all.
3. **Write the finding** — `artifacts/findings/<slug>-<date>.md`: the
   narrative arc (dated events, actors, money, open questions), frame-neutral,
   every claim carrying a source link.
4. **Bundle it** — `artifacts/bundles/<slug>-<date>/provenance.yaml` (query
   → items → run manifests); add `captures/` only for evidence-grade cites
   that could vanish.
5. **Backfill the timeline** — distill the finding into dated entries
   appended under `## ← Backstory` in `artifacts/threads/<slug>.md`, each
   tagged `⟨crawl <date>⟩` (the finding stays the deep artifact; the
   timeline gets the readable spine); set `crawled:` in its frontmatter.
   Any dated *future* expectations the crawl surfaces go into
   `attention/upcoming.yaml` (`logged_by: crawl`).
6. **Close the loop** — update the thread's `notes:`/`watch:` with what the
   backstory settled; surface the finding in the next daily's read (the
   thread's page view picks the backstory up at the next render).
