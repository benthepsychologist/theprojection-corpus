"""readouts.py — per-page executive readouts for every page of the site.

WHY (Ben, 2026-07-29): "leverage cheap sonnet class LLMs to put an exec
readout on literally every page. timestamp behind the scenes. mechanical
scan to see what needs updating." The readout is the shape he asked for:

    BREAKING   same-day items
    NEWS       items from the last 7 days
    SUMMARY    the curated built understanding — the actual point

BREAKING and NEWS are DERIVED MECHANICALLY here (they are just dated items
routed to the scope) — no model touches them, so they can never drift from
the record. Only SUMMARY is written by a model, and only when the inputs
under it have actually changed.

SUMMARY IS STRUCTURED, NOT PROSE (Ben, 2026-07-29: "I wanted bullets and
emojis and delight. It's still just a paragraph."). Schema v1 stored it as
a free string, and every one of the 160 real summaries came back as a
single unbroken paragraph — median 607 characters, zero newlines, zero
bullets. Prompting alone will not hold that line; the SHAPE is the fix, so
the store holds slots a template lays out:

    summary = {
      gist:    one sentence — the whole thing, if you read nothing else
      bullets: 3-5 × {emoji, text, url} — each a full SENTENCE, not a
               fragment, ranked by salience with NO lens quota
      watch:   one sentence — the open question, what would change the read
      beats:   FRONT ONLY — {ai, global-capital, mental-health}, one sentence each
    }

Ben's rule for the front (2026-07-29): rank the big bullets by salience and
do NOT force lens balance into them, but guarantee cross-lens coverage
underneath with at least a sentence per beat. So the two live side by side:
`bullets` is pure salience, `beats` is the balance floor.

`emoji` comes from a FIXED typed set (see SUMMARY_EMOJI) — the emoji marks
what KIND of development it is, and never carries a fact on its own (the
voice pipeline strips all but six status emojis).

THE MECHANICAL SCAN is the cost control. Every scope gets a FINGERPRINT
over exactly the inputs that could change its summary — item ids, timeline
entry dates/headings, last_seen, pending expectations, active flashes. If
the fingerprint matches what is stored, the scope is fresh and NOTHING is
regenerated. On a normal day a handful of scopes move, not 233.

THE SPLIT (kestrel convention): this tool does no judgment. It scans,
packs, validates and stores. The session dispatches sonnet agents against
`--pack`, and feeds their JSON back through `--apply`, which validates
before anything is written.

Usage:
  python3 tools/readouts.py --scan                 # what is stale, and why
  python3 tools/readouts.py --pack-stale [--limit N] > packs.json
  python3 tools/readouts.py --apply generated.json
  python3 tools/readouts.py --export               # -> artifacts/readouts/readouts.json

Scopes: front · thread:<slug> · entity:<slug> · node:<slug>
Claim and metric pages are deliberately EXCLUDED — a claim page is a single
metric's receipt and a metric page is a methodology note; a rolling news
readout on either is noise, not understanding.
