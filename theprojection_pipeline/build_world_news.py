"""tools/build_world_news.py — the orchestration layer that writes
attention/world-news.yaml, merging two independent detection sources:

  - tools/world_news.py    google_news_rss clustered by shared title
                           keywords -- real headlines, real outlet names,
                           but only sees stories that overlap a
                           watchlist/thread term (kestrel's collection is
                           entirely term-driven; see world_news.py's
                           header, "Finding 1").
  - tools/gdelt_dedup.py   GDELT's Events table, deduped + syndicate-
                           collapsed -- genuinely untargeted (no query
                           term needed), but has no article text at all,
                           so its "headline" is a country-pair + CAMEO
                           event-code label, not real prose.

Each source alone has a real gap the other one closes: google_news_rss
misses anything outside our own terms; GDELT misses anything that isn't
a coded event (a product launch, a lawsuit, an earnings beat -- most of
what world_news.py actually surfaces). Neither replaces the other.

CROSS-REFERENCING: a GDELT "intl" bucket (a country pair) is matched
against an EXISTING kestrel thread only if BOTH country names appear as
whole words in that thread's terms/title/watch text -- deliberately
strict (single-country substring matching would false-positive constantly:
a "China" bucket would match nearly every AI thread). A GDELT bucket that
matches no thread and clears a domain-count + severity bar becomes a
standalone `source: gdelt` candidate, with a readable headline built from
country names (a full ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 -> common-name map -- no
`pycountry` in this environment, stdlib only) + the CAMEO root-code
label, NOT the raw URL-slug proxy (which is often garbled -- see
gdelt_dedup.py's own header).

`domestic-generic` GDELT buckets are EXCLUDED entirely from candidate
generation -- they are real category aggregations ("US + Fight"), not
single stories, exactly as gdelt_dedup.py's own header names.

    # Uniform thread-match pass. Two TWO INDEPENDENT tiers -- no fallback
    # between them, after two rounds of real bugs found re-checking the
    # FULL output (not just a handful of spot-checked cases):
    #
    #  1. A headline naming 2+ recognized countries (GDELT intl items, and
    #     any rss headline that happens to name two countries) uses ONLY
    #     match_country_pair()'s proximity check. If no thread's timeline
    #     discusses both countries near each other, the item stays a
    #     CANDIDATE -- it does NOT fall through to keyword matching, which
    #     is how "Iran-United States: Fight" ended up confirming
    #     datacenter-power-grid: both names appeared somewhere in that
    #     long timeline, in unrelated contexts, and the fallback treated
    #     that as if it were a real match.
    #  2. A headline with 0-1 recognized countries uses `_keywords()`
    #     against thread's SHORT blob (title+terms+watch) ONLY, >=2 hits,
    #     best score wins. Restricting to short fields (not the full
    #     timeline) is itself a fix: matching against a long, sprawling
    #     document lets incidental word co-occurrence beat genuine
    #     relevance by raw count -- "The Hugging Face break-in explained"
    #     matched china-stack-independence (which merely happens to
    #     contain "hugging", "face" AND "break" somewhere across its
    #     history) over openai-agent-security-incident (the correct
    #     thread, whose short watch field names Hugging Face directly),
    #     because the long thread's incidental count was higher.
